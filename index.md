# Main Section
Online News System is a perfect platform for blogging, news, and more! The main features that ONS lacks are search and HTML-free systems! ONS is in beta (v0.0.1) so the CSS is simply awful, but I am planning to update it. Please note that the GitHub version is a slightly slimmet down version of this
ONS is sort of like <a href="https://blot.im" target="_blank">Blot</a> but 100% free, open-sourced, and self-hosted.
